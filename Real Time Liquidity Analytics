üí∏ Real-Time Liquidity Management Platform

This project demonstrates an end-to-end system for monitoring, analyzing, and optimizing liquidity in financial transactions using both SQL and Python. It integrates batch and real-time data processing to ensure efficient cash flow management and provides actionable insights for decision-making.

üéØ Project Objectives

  Real-Time Liquidity Monitoring: Capture and process financial transaction data in real time to track cash flow across accounts.

  Liquidity Analysis: Use SQL for batch analytics to identify patterns and predict shortfalls.

  Actionable Insights: Generate alerts and recommendations based on liquidity thresholds using Python.

‚öôÔ∏è Proposed Tech Stack

  SQL: For data storage, transformations, and analytics (Snowflake or PostgreSQL)

  Python: For real-time processing, alerts, and visualization

  Kafka: For streaming real-time transaction data

  Apache Airflow: For orchestrating batch jobs

  Visualization: Dash or Power BI for liquidity dashboards

üìú Features

1. Data Ingestion

  * Real-Time Streaming: Financial transaction systems continuously send transaction data (e.g., debits, credits) via APIs or message queues like Apache Kafka.

  * Batch Imports: Historical transactions and account data are periodically ingested using ETL pipelines (e.g., Fivetran or Python scripts).

  * Storage: All ingested data is stored in a central database or data warehouse like Snowflake, organized by schemas (staging, processed).

2. Data Processing and Transformation

* Real-Time Aggregations:

  - Kafka consumers process incoming transactions in real time, updating running balances and flags for critical accounts directly in the database.

  - Pre-computed aggregations (e.g., RunningBalance) are refreshed dynamically via SQL triggers or scheduled scripts.

3. Batch Transformations:

  * Using tools like dbt or SQL, daily or hourly summaries calculate key metrics like total inflows, outflows, and net liquidity.

  * Results are written to reporting tables for downstream analysis.

3. Automated Alerts

  * Threshold Monitoring:
  
    - Python scripts or embedded database logic check running balances against predefined thresholds in real time.
    
    - Alerts (e.g., SMS, emails, or Slack notifications) are triggered for accounts at risk of overdraft or liquidity shortages.

Recommendations:

If a threshold breach is detected, the system suggests automated actions such as transferring funds or delaying payments, using decision rules coded in Python.

4. Visualization and Reporting

  * A live dashboard (built with Dash, Tableau, or Power BI) automatically refreshes to display:
  
  * Account Balances: Real-time view of liquidity status across all accounts.
  
  * Trend Analysis: Historical inflows, outflows, and balances for decision-making.
  
  * Alert Status: Highlighting critical accounts in red for immediate action.

5. Orchestration

  * Apache Airflow handles task scheduling:
  
  * Real-time tasks like Kafka consumers run continuously.
  
  * Batch tasks like SQL transformations or daily summaries execute on predefined schedules.

üìä Example Dataset

Sample Transaction Data (transactions.csv):

TransactionID	AccountID	TransactionType	Amount	      Timestamp
      1	        101	      Credit	      1000.00	    2023-01-01 10:00:00
      2	        101	      Debit	        -500.00	    2023-01-01 10:15:00
      3	        102	      Credit	      1500.00	     2023-01-01 10:20:00

üìÇ SQL Scripts

1. Real-Time Balance Calculation (real_time_balance.sql)

-- Calculate real-time running balances for each account

SELECT
    AccountID,
    SUM(Amount) AS RunningBalance,
    MAX(Timestamp) AS LastTransaction
FROM transactions
GROUP BY AccountID;

2. Batch Liquidity Metrics (batch_liquidity_metrics.sql)

-- Summarize inflows, outflows, and balance trends
WITH AggregatedData AS (
    SELECT
        AccountID,
        SUM(CASE WHEN TransactionType = 'Credit' THEN Amount ELSE 0 END) AS TotalInflows,
        SUM(CASE WHEN TransactionType = 'Debit' THEN ABS(Amount) ELSE 0 END) AS TotalOutflows
    FROM transactions
    GROUP BY AccountID
)
SELECT
    AccountID,
    TotalInflows,
    TotalOutflows,
    (TotalInflows - TotalOutflows) AS NetLiquidity
FROM AggregatedData;

üìÇ Python Scripts

1. Transaction Streaming (kafka_producer.py)

from kafka import KafkaProducer
import json
import time

# Simulated transaction data
transactions = [
    {"TransactionID": 1, "AccountID": 101, "TransactionType": "Credit", "Amount": 1000.0, "Timestamp": "2023-01-01T10:00:00"},
    {"TransactionID": 2, "AccountID": 101, "TransactionType": "Debit", "Amount": -500.0, "Timestamp": "2023-01-01T10:15:00"}
]

producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092', value_serializer=lambda v: json.dumps(v).encode('utf-8'))

# Stream transactions
for transaction in transactions:
    producer.send('transactions', transaction)
    print(f"Sent: {transaction}")
    time.sleep(1)

2. Liquidity Alerts (liquidity_alerts.py)

import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = pd.read_csv("data/transactions.csv")

# Compute running balances
data['RunningBalance'] = data.groupby('AccountID')['Amount'].cumsum()

# Generate alerts
alerts = data[data['RunningBalance'] < 1000]
for _, row in alerts.iterrows():
    print(f"ALERT: Account {row['AccountID']} has low balance: ${row['RunningBalance']:.2f}")

üìä Visualization

Run dashboard.py to launch a real-time liquidity dashboard. Example dashboard includes:

Account Balances: Real-time visualization of balances by account.
Liquidity Trends: Line chart of inflows and outflows.
Alert Panel: Highlight accounts below threshold.

üöÄ How the workflow would run in the real world 

1. Transaction Processing:

  * A new transaction (Account 101, Debit, $500) is sent to Kafka.

  * Kafka triggers a Python consumer, which:

      -Updates the running balance in Snowflake.

      -Checks thresholds, if breached, an alert is triggered.

2. Daily Summary Pipeline:

  * At midnight, Airflow runs:

    -SQL scripts to aggregate daily metrics (inflows, outflows).

    -Python scripts to refresh dashboards and generate recommendations.

3. Insights Delivery:

  * The refreshed dashboard provides a comprehensive liquidity snapshot by morning.

  * Alerts and recommendations from the previous day are emailed to relevant stakeholders.
